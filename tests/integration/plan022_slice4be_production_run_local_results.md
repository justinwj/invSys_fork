# Slice4be Production Run local observations

Current decision update,2026-10-11: the user explicitly approved RUN-SCALE-01 and
RUN-UI-01. Architecture v4.11 D18, Plan022 and Controls record both approvals in
docs commit `9dc7cbc`. Earlier references below to pending approval retain their
historical meaning. RUN-UI-01 evidence follows; RUN-SCALE-01 implementation and
broader acceptance remain required.

## RUN-UI-01 approved wording, 2026-10-11

Unpromoted `deploy/validation-run-ui-01` replaces the misleading allocation-success
message with the exact approved failure text when the worksheet owner cannot stage
the allocation. The existing FAILED fact and partial effects remain unchanged;
there is no repair or rollback. Success wording and reusable allocation are unchanged.
`frmProduction` delegates wording to its existing allocation action module.

`Test-Slice4beProductionRunLocal.ps1 -WorksheetOnly` calls the actual List/Tree
Apply handlers with an Admin-seeded entity. RED on General02 is272 PASS/4 FAIL;
GREEN on UI01 is276/276. All272 historical check identities retain relative order;
four visible-page checks are added. The four formerly proposed assertions now
require the exact approved text. The current-catalog assertion is updated24→31;
historical catalog definitions remain intact. Quantity/percent/zero/refusal cases,
exact identity, custom columns/formula, immutable observations, redaction, terminal
classification and source/operator/settings/package preservation pass.

RED controller `production-run-local-controller/e1872156efbb4535840900340779eff2`,
worker `slice4be-production-run-worksheet/d8f1a830d72846fb8e390e9050a60e98`:

`slice4be-production-run-worksheet/a4aca290c2f74501b23327a457b27f94`:
UTC20:02:07.569--20:04:12.133. Both have five instrumented compiles, unassisted
closure and zero delayed Excel events through12 seconds after closure. Controller
qualified receipts pin results/retention. Four GREEN captures show the complete
failure message; existing Tree header overlap and clipped long row values remain
separate layout limitations. Agent image review is not human acceptance.

`run-ui-build-01/verification.json` records five cold compiles and exactly two
changed packaged components (form/allocation module), with310 unchanged. The
General02 packages and local settings are preserved; delayed native audit is clean.
`run-ui-static-01/ratchet-verification.json` records319 components,6341 procedures,
138720 lines: one necessary wording helper/eight lines added, no form growth,
unchanged dynamic9/45,192 duplicate candidates and all28 size caps. Three schemas
and456 PowerShell parses pass. Smoke86/86 is clean at
`run-ui-regression/smoke-9e9c8b22f6e74878831a82136b16c9a4`, including restart,
unassisted closure, preservation and delayed zero Excel events.
The ordinary full chain now passes32/32, live-role48/48 and Create Warehouse15/15

`run-ui-regression/chain-ffb39bcfa3bc4582aaed19ff4b51bc96/verification.json`:
UTC20:06:31.303--20:12:23.927, zero Excel events through20:12:35.927. Normal
unassisted closure, package/settings/tracked-report preservation and restart pass.
This qualifies the current run; it does not identify or repair the prior
intermittent native/automation failures. RUN-SCALE-01 remains approved but
unimplemented; broader4be-A and human acceptance remain open.

## Independent List and Tree Apply Action Paths

The unchanged, unpromoted allocate01 candidate passes **104/104** packaged path
checks under Architecture v4.11 D18. Two independent recordings each invoke List
Apply, explicitly reselect the retained stock row in List, then invoke Tree Apply.
Released recipe, stock, location and quantity prerequisites are prepared before
recording. The reselection follows the existing List selection event and preserves
the owning allocation; no hidden owner restaging occurs between buttons. Both
actual handlers enter the stock owner once and retain their established results,
messages and restored guards. This tests the reusable branch; it does not promote
experimental Tree into D15 Release1 workflow acceptance.

Final negative control on refresh01: controller

14:34:23.4382827--14:36:24.1274184 UTC: **47 PASS/one missing original Apply pair**.
All48 identities/order/results match the earlier negative control. Actual owner,
message and guard checks pass; the unavailable recording is behavioral RED.

GREEN on allocate01: controller
`reports/runtime/production-run-local-controller/eeaa401059fc44ff91b8201f2b5c67be`,
result `reports/runtime/slice4be-production-run-allocate-paths/3e839fb291dc4f16b107ec1b596de974/green.json`,
14:36:54.9848869--14:44:20.9770075 UTC: **104 unique GREEN**. All48 RED identities
retain relative order, all47 passes survive and the missing pair becomes GREEN;
56 later checks also pass. All42 shared GREEN identities/order survive. Actual
Admin publication preserves each original line. Selected Event Detail switches
between the exact REQUESTED and STAGED records. Explicit guide intent refers to
its source recording; an independent reader evaluates the separate observed run.
Two ordered matches and zero extras conclude local CommandCompleted, while
SourceEventsApplied remains incomplete. How-To, Diagnostic and Compare retain
the same exact evidence/provenance without mutating journals, activity, saved
authority or the captured operator workbook and its extra column.

Both gates pass five instrumented compiles, canonical package pins, settings
restoration, normal unassisted closure and delayed zero Excel Application1000/
1001/1002 audits. No runtime code, architecture, catalog or package rebuild changes.

Seven `run-allocate-*.png` captures in the GREEN result directory were reviewed;
`capture-review.json` pins their hashes and limitations. List shows actual local
allocation. Tree remains empty for this reusable fixture and retains overlapping
System_Key/Inventory Item headers; its handler uses the retained List selection.
This is visible evidence of existing limitations, not populated-Tree acceptance.
Event Detail shows the selected STAGED fact. All three path views visibly separate
authored instructions from observed actions and show the local-only conclusion.
The conclusion already fits the viewport; these captures do not establish long
scrolling or human acceptance.

Static `reports/runtime/run-allocate-path-static-02` retains289 components,6171
procedures,135434 lines,9/45 dynamic calls,190 duplicate candidates and28 non-growing
caps. Three schemas and368 PowerShell parses pass; runtime growth is zero.
Shared Refresh paths retain **167/167** in exact prior order on the same candidate:
controller `reports/runtime/production-run-local-controller/c3eafeaea2574858b85df222e90bd462`,
result `reports/runtime/slice4be-production-run-refresh-paths/7a843c6bee0242458882f873cdaa14ea/green.json`,
14:44:58.0016179--14:54:19.8894514 UTC. Five compiles, canonical pins, preservation,
normal unassisted closure and delayed zero audit pass. The reviewed Compare and
scrolled-conclusion captures show five ordered matches, zero extras and local-only
completion; their hashes are pinned in `comparison-capture-review.json`. This
regression protects shared recording, publication, authoring and reader paths.
Remaining coverage, populated layout, broad release and human acceptance stay open.

## List and Tree Apply integration checkpoint

Unpromoted `deploy/validation-production-run-allocate-01` implements the two
existing Apply observations under unchanged D18. Constructed-button wiring is
63/68; eight of catalog24's nine handlers are integrated. Scale, four additional
Run buttons, nonbutton coverage and broader acceptance remain open. RUN-SCALE-01
and RUN-UI-01 remain unapproved; no proposed message or branch change is implemented.

`modProductionRunAllocateActions` owns captured begin/finish, capability checks,
loading/nested suppression and the existing List-only refill/auto-selection.
The form reports the worksheet owner boundary directly, retaining input-source
precedence, header-based writes, mirroring, location-refusal clearing and partial
effects. Missing required local surfaces produce FAILED observations while their
existing displayed wording remains governed by the pending RUN-UI-01 decision.
The extracted reusable UI branch retains quantity precedence, validation and
exact stock allocation. Owner exceptions supply FAILED without status parsing;
entity-read returns check captured continuation before later work. The two existing
quantity/non-counted readers move to a typed helper; direct calls without an
action retain their prior behavior. No inventory submission or new read path.

Build `reports/runtime/run-allocate-build-01`,13:22:28.0900058--13:23:06.6123014 UTC,

Settings and refresh01 packages are preserved; normal closure and delayed zero
Excel Application1000/1001/1002 audit pass.

unchanged proposed wording failures in the272-check report. All prior identities,
order and passes remain; exactly112 approved checks improve. Actual List/Tree
handlers retain quantity/percent/zero/refusal effects, custom values/formulas and
exact Admin-created keys, canonical source, redacted original pairs and empty
source references. Five compiles, package/settings/operator/authority/older-record
preservation, normal closure and delayed zero Excel audit pass.

13:26:20.4242024--13:29:31.2113964 UTC: **142 PASS/4 known Scale FAIL/146 unique**.
All prior identities/order/passes remain; ten Apply checks improve. All18 Apply
checks pass: actual entity read returns before sign-out, later reads stop, owner
and projection state at the interruption are preserved, refusal is visible,
guards restore, and only the original REQUESTED record remains. The test retains
the real read result; it does not replace it with fabricated failure data. Five
compiles, canonical allocate01 pins, preservation, normal closure and delayed
zero Excel audit pass. This first-read interruption gate does not establish every
later conversion-specific read boundary; the expanded gate below supplies it.
Source review resolves the suspected extra read between conversion and the guard:
Core `ValidateQuantityForUom`, `UomRequiresWholeQuantity` and `NormalizeUomName`
perform only local numeric/string validation, with no configuration/authority
read or yield. The guard precedes the next actual entity read and owning mutation.
No defect or runtime guard change follows from that suspicion. The expanded
conversion-return and later entity-return gate below uses a legitimately released
differing-UOM definition and actual results.

identities/order/passes remain;56 Apply observation checks improve. Real Receiving
creates the second entity before measured planning. Both actual Apply handlers
retain quantity/percent expansion over two distinct keys, zero clearing and
over-bucket refusal, canonical source and exact local state. Observations contain
no exact keys or source references. Five compiles, canonical pins, preservation,
normal closure and delayed zero Excel audit pass.

All prior identities/order/passes remain; ten Apply denial checks improve. Both
Apply actions deny before owner reads/mutation and retain authorized behavior
when tracking is off, excluded by the older catalog, or unavailable; unavailable
guidance remains visible. Five compiles, canonical pins and preservation pass.
Excel remains live briefly after assertions, then closes without intervention;
terminal cleanup and delayed zero Excel audit pass. No shutdown repair is claimed.

13:43:40.5385969--13:52:27.0825592 UTC: **437 PASS/66 FAIL/503 unique**. Despite the
filename, this is not the expected GREEN gate. All prior identities/order/passes,
33 owner cases and42 shared checks remain;148 checks improve. The eight missing
expected improvements all belong to `RunLocal.ALLOCATE.RefillPalette` and depend
on its expected STAGED result. Seven native forms survive captured-workbook closure
and their actual handlers execute/refuse; no dismissed-form invocation is inferred.
Five compiles, canonical pins, preservation, normal closure and delayed zero audit
pass. The following diagnosis is required before interpreting those eight failures.

13:58:50.4957074--14:00:33.8690259 UTC. Both receipts prove a loaded reusable run,
zero palette rows before/after, zero allocation-owner invocations, preserved owner
state and the existing no-choices refusal. Refresh01 has no records; allocate01
correctly has one REQUESTED and one REJECTED, with no STAGED. Five compiles,
preservation, unassisted closure and delayed zero audits pass for both.

The test's STAGED expectation was incorrect under D18: selection refusal is
REJECTED, and local completion requires the actual successful owner boundary.
No runtime repair is made. The correction retains all503 full-suite identities
and the original refill owner-state check; it does not substitute a no-local-effect
assertion, because refill can clear local presentation. The separate narrow gate
adds five explicit refusal checks. Corrected frozen refresh01 RED: controller

again proves zero owner calls and STAGED records, preserved owner state and the
existing refusal, with one REQUESTED and one REJECTED. Five compiles, canonical

All prior ordered identities/passes remain;156 Apply checks improve. All33 owner

workbook's closure; all seven actual handlers enter and refuse, preserving owner
state and saved bytes without redirected activity. Five compiles, canonical pins,
settings/operator/authority/older-record preservation, normal unassisted closure
and delayed zero Excel audit pass. The controller waits for Excel to exit while
retaining restoration state; no shutdown intervention or native fix is claimed.
This Run-local gate does not replace the separate full reusable171/replay37 gate.

Expanded read-return RED uses a differing convertible requirement UOM entered
before the actual Process Save/Release fixture. It never alters a loaded released
definition, fabricates a read result or changes the handler. Successful stock and
exact-entity UOM returns must prove positive conversion and differing real units;
the second, third and fourth inventory returns use explicit occurrence counts.
Ten new interruption cases add90 checks while preserving the original146 checks.

All prior ordered identities/passes remain;60 Apply checks improve, including
all50 new negative-control failures. All108 Apply checks pass across both handlers'
first inventory read, two real conversion returns and second/third/fourth entity
reads. No later observed reads or owner/projection changes follow invalidation;
refusal is visible, guards restore and the original REQUESTED record is retained
without a misattributed outcome. Five compiles, canonical pins, preservation,
normal unassisted closure and delayed zero audit pass. Runtime remains unchanged
since the original Apply build. Static03 retains the runtime manifest fields and
all maintenance metrics from static01, with the expanded tooling parsed.

The independent reusable Apply path gate is recorded above. Remaining path scope,
layout and release gates remain open. No human acceptance is claimed.

Architecture v4.11 D18 specifies nine catalog24 controls under approved semantic
inheritance: Scale, Clear, Load, Loader/Manager Refresh, List/Tree Apply and Tree
Expand/Collapse. Owner is PRODUCTION_RUN_LOCAL. Local completion is distinct from
inventory application; these controls carry no source-event references. D15's
experimental Tree status and D14's exact-key/unknown-column rules remain binding.

This record includes historical test-first baselines and later bounded changes;
it does not establish completed implementation or acceptance. The initial runtime
was catalog23/118 IDs and55/68 constructed Production buttons. The separate
full reusable native crash remains unresolved; see
`plan022_slice4be_production_assignment_results.md` for its bounded diagnostics
and the thirty verified shared gates on the frozen Assignment candidate.

## Protecting test and candidate

`tests/tooling/Test-Slice4beProductionRunPresentation.ps1` runs the isolated
ConfigCommands harness against frozen, unpromoted
`deploy/validation-production-assignment-01`. Its unsaved adapters in
`Slice4beProductionRunPresentation.ps1` call the original packaged
`mBtnRunTreeExpandAll_Click` / `mBtnRunTreeCollapseAll_Click` handlers, not replacement
handlers. They stage synthetic local palette rows without inventory writes.
The opt-in gate is independent of the existing ConfigCommands selections.

The initial baseline covers only this presentation pair: expanded/collapsed/
process-collapsed/empty trees, repeated actions, unchanged palette contents,
fixed metadata, exact paired observations, redaction/integrity/terminal semantics,
loading/busy suppression, stale target/session/sign-out/closed workbook, saved
authority, unknown local values/formula and older-record preservation. All nine
controls, the complete optional-policy/failure/yield matrix and paired Action Path
publication/reader evidence remain required before implementation acceptance.
No runtime source, package build, deployment or promotion has changed here.

The134 failures are exactly two absent catalog definitions,112 absent observation/
terminal facts, four missing loading/busy guards and16 missing captured-context
mutation/refusal guards. Every existing tree shape, palette value and status check
passes, including preserved collapsed Process groups and empty/repeated actions.
All42 prior shared checks remain GREEN in exact order; the other56 passes establish
the preserved owner/preservation behavior. No assertion is removed or relaxed.

`verification.json` records five instrumented package compiles, canonical frozen
package pins, preserved packages/settings, normal unassisted closure, no remaining
Excel and zero delayed Application1000/1001/1002 failures. This is meaningful RED
for the two actual handlers only. It neither protects all nine controls nor
completes the optional-policy/failure/yield/recording matrix. No screenshot or
human-acceptance claim is supplied by this baseline.

Static evidence `reports/runtime/run-presentation-static-01`:280 components,

scripts parse. Runtime metrics/source are unchanged. The two unrelated document
hashes remain pinned and preserved. Desktop monitoring through this baseline
reported no new Win32 error5; it does not guarantee future unlocked access.

  found zero failures. Error91 is not desktop Win32 error5. The next adapter returns
  only a fixed failing setup stage and numeric error, rather than leaving a dialog.
- Controller `reports/runtime/production-run-presentation-controller/c14544f577b04218a052da0d819bee85`,
  2026-10-01 06:05:53.3664289--06:07:14.8565239 UTC:39 PASS/2 FAIL.
  The bounded fixture diagnostic identifies TreeState/error91. In the adapter,
  `EnsureRunTreeState:` was parsed as a VBA label rather than a no-argument call,
  so the dictionary was never initialized. Separating the call onto its own line
  corrects only the fixture. This diagnostic is excluded from RED; five compiles,
  unassisted closure, preservation and delayed zero-failure audit pass. Do not
  repeat the colon form for no-argument procedure calls in VBA adapters.

## Seven-control reusable baseline

The seven-control reusable baseline is protected through
`Test-Slice4beProductionRunLocal.ps1`, `Slice4beProductionRunLocalProbe.ps1` and
`Slice4beProductionRunLocalActivity.ps1`. Admin Generate Warehouse/Seed supplies
real inventory; actual Process/Recipe Save/Release supplies released definitions.
The tests invoke Load, Scale, Clear, Loader/Manager Refresh and List/Tree Apply
unchanged. They cover scale limits, reset of prior allocation/actual-output/note
state, false-load clearing, allocation quantity precedence, single-row selection,
palette refill, input/location/requirement refusals and captured-context guards.
The completed-node scale refusal uses explicitly synthetic local state; it is
not evidence of completing a Process or applying inventory events. Worksheet
branches, multiple-key bucket expansion, full policy/fault/yield and paired-path
coverage remain required. No runtime implementation is changed.

First seven-control attempt is excluded: controller
`reports/runtime/production-run-local-controller/4350b735ccc14405bb566769dc57c56a`,
result `reports/runtime/slice4be-production-run-local/013b5feff05f4bf6aea1e35f96ea75d6/red.json`,
2026-10-01 06:17:08.7487641--06:25:26.0073287 UTC. Its460 unique checks contain
131 PASS/329 FAIL, including two harness/cleanup failures. All33 measured owner
behavior cases pass before the failure; this partial observation is not protecting
RED. Invoking a retained form reference during repeated closed-workbook cases
raised VBA80010007 and RPC800706BE. Windows Application1000 at06:24:02.3256648 UTC
records c0000005, with1001 at06:24:13.8035447. These are not desktop Win32 error5.
The owned End action and closing three verified, saved temporary-fixture recovery
workbooks without saving are assisted cleanup. Settings/packages were preserved
and Excel exited; final canonical-authority preservation was not reached/proven.

The corrected fixture follows the established Assignment/worksheet native-lifetime
pattern: show the actual form, measure visibility and exact workbook closure,
invoke the handler through an outer trapped adapter only if the form survives,
and record dismissal as no handler invocation. Independently retain the typed
closed-binding check, in-memory owner state, disk bytes and activity counts.
Cache fixture identities before disposal and release the old reference before
opening the next workbook. `-ClosedDiagnostic` exercises only that boundary and
cannot substitute for the complete seven-control baseline. No native-lifetime
or broader reusable-crash repair is claimed.

The narrow closure diagnostic, controller
`reports/runtime/production-run-local-controller/ed6efd93ba594c09a73003d33b06603d`,
result `reports/runtime/slice4be-production-run-local-closed/155320e9e9334bf798c7ee4925ac0f2a/red.json`,
2026-10-01 06:27:29.7044899--06:29:44.9533729 UTC, has84 PASS/5 expected FAIL/89
unique checks. SCALE, LOADER_REFRESH and ALLOCATE survived closure and entered
their actual handlers without adapter errors; the other four forms were dismissed
and their handlers were not invoked. Owner mutation/refusal guards account for
the five failures. Five compiles, preservation, unassisted closure and delayed
zero Excel Application failures pass. This was a fixture diagnostic only.

The full baseline additionally selects the actual List/Tree Run page before each
closure. Controller
`reports/runtime/production-run-local-controller/2b5df5badbba45019b981d281d216d23`,
result `reports/runtime/slice4be-production-run-local/4e9de4535352471483dbb279664df653/red.json`,

unique checks**. All33 existing owner cases and42 prior shared GREEN identities
in exact order pass. Failures are seven absent metadata definitions,264 absent
observation/terminal checks,14 missing loading/busy guards,40 changed-context
mutation/refusal checks and seven surviving-form closed-context guard checks.
The two Target allocation cases already preserve state through existing owner
validation; their missing explicit context refusal still fails independently.

All seven native closure receipts prove visible Run pages, exact captured-book
closure and preserved decoy. LOAD, CLEAR, LOADER_REFRESH and ALLOCATE survived
and entered their handlers with adapter error0. SCALE, MANAGER_REFRESH and
TREE_ALLOCATE were dismissed, so no handler invocation is claimed for them.
Native lifetime varies between runs; dismissal is never counted as a handler
test. All saved authority/operator bytes, unknown values/formula and older
activity records remain unchanged. Five compiles, canonical frozen package pins,
settings/package preservation, normal unassisted closure and delayed zero Excel
Application1000/1001/1002 failures are verified in the controller's
`verification.json`. Runtime source/builds remain unchanged. This protects the
seven reusable branches, not worksheet branches or the full nine-control gate.

Static `reports/runtime/run-local-baseline-static-01` retains280 components,
6150 procedures,135006 lines,9 literal/45 unresolved dynamic calls,190 duplicate
bodies and28 non-growing caps; three schemas and359 script parses pass.

## Supplemental Core contract RED

`Test-Slice4beProductionRunLocal.ps1 -ContractOnly` runs
`Slice4beProductionRunContract.ps1` separately from the operator-handler baselines.
Controller `reports/runtime/production-run-local-controller/67b171a992eb4881a7de972256be7bf8`,
result `reports/runtime/slice4be-production-run-contract/36394b1a48134c2c9e374678ed0e6c4c/red.json`,
2026-10-01 06:40:14.2539766--06:41:32.7523882 UTC: **492 PASS/272 expected FAIL/764
unique checks**, retaining all42 shared checks GREEN in exact order. All nine
controls are checked for catalog23 exclusion, catalog24 extension and preservation
of118 existing definitions, enabled/disabled defaults, fourteen candidate outcome
codes, exact terminal classification, wrong owner/catalog rejection and rejection
of Inventory/Designs references in both Submitted and Unknown states.

Failures are119 catalog24 extension/definition-preservation assertions,18 absent
defaults,45 absent supported outcome definitions, nine absent positive terminals
and81 unsupported outcomes currently accepted by the generic empty-reference
decoder. This does not mean that118 existing catalog23 definitions regressed:
catalog24 does not yet exist. Five instrumented compiles, frozen pins, settings/
package preservation, unassisted closure and delayed zero Excel Application
failures pass. This supplements actual handlers; it supplies no human acceptance.

## Optional-policy and denial RED

`Test-Slice4beProductionRunLocal.ps1 -PolicyOnly` uses the original nine handlers,
real Admin-seeded/released reusable fixture, and the existing synthetic local
Tree presentation fixture. It checks denied-user entry, disabled collection,
catalog23 policy compatibility, Navigation default-off, unavailable activity
storage, suppression of programmatic setup events and saved/local preservation.
Only disposable fixture paths are moved/restored to simulate unavailable storage.

Initial controller `reports/runtime/production-run-local-controller/2a94d6e91a4a48c98738cf89c1075b6a`,

unique checks. These failures cover27 denied-user protection/record checks and
nine unavailable-tracking notices. Five compiles, preservation, normal closure
and delayed zero Excel audit pass. State equality alone cannot prove absence of
owner reads, so the next run adds nine explicit owner-entry counters.

unique checks**. All209 prior identities/results retain their exact order; the
nine additional failures prove denied actions enter the existing reusable owner
or Tree presentation routine. All29 authorized optional-policy action cases
preserve their existing results, including the populated Tree shape/palette.
Programmatic setup produces no observations. Forty-two shared checks, five
compiles, canonical package pins, saved authority/operator bytes, unknown values/
formula, older records and other-warehouse activity preservation all pass.
Unassisted closure and delayed zero Excel Application1000/1001/1002 failures are
verified. No handler or runtime implementation was replaced or changed.

All361 tooling scripts parse. Runtime source and the validated three-schema
static baseline remain unchanged at280 components/6150 procedures/135006 lines,
9 literal/45 unresolved calls,190 duplicate bodies and28 non-growing caps.

## Owner-exception and nested-click RED

`Test-Slice4beProductionRunLocal.ps1 -FaultOnly` installs unsaved boundary hooks
through `Slice4beProductionRunFault.ps1`; all nine original handlers remain
intact. Nine exception cases and nine one-shot nested actual clicks reach their
intended owner routines. Exception hooks retain existing propagation/handled
failure behavior and local effects: Load has already cleared the reusable owner;
Loader Refresh has already refreshed recipe lists. No rollback is asserted.
Guard state is measured before any adapter reset, avoiding a test-created cleanup
that could hide a stuck runtime guard.

Controller `reports/runtime/production-run-local-controller/47316acdc3d74b7b8474c773dd9e48f3`,
result `reports/runtime/slice4be-production-run-fault/b3e401ded2304f9a92b5d54d15b5d2cc/red.json`,

unique checks**. Failures are108 absent observation/terminal facts, nine repeated
owner entries and the nested Load result disturbed by reentry. All18 boundaries,
existing exception propagation/partial effects and guard-restoration measurements
pass. The nested Load failure protects the approved nesting guard; it does not
authorize changing the ordinary load algorithm.

All42 prior shared checks retain exact GREEN order. Five compiles, canonical
package pins, saved authority/operator bytes, unknown values/formula, older
records and other-warehouse activity preservation pass. Cleanup is unassisted;
delayed Excel Application1000/1001/1002 failures are zero. Runtime/source metrics
remain unchanged;362 scripts parse. This is a bounded owner-exception/nesting
baseline. Real-read failures/yields, worksheet branches, exact stock-bucket
expansion and independent paired paths remain open.

## Real-read sign-out RED

`Test-Slice4beProductionRunLocal.ps1 -YieldOnly` uses
`Slice4beProductionRunYield.ps1` and the common fault fixture. The first attempt,
controller `reports/runtime/production-run-local-controller/1e0e4adb8a47437ebb7f98f7a7249fdd`,
result `reports/runtime/slice4be-production-run-yield/653ab2e07ef3466c8597eb362e2c60b6/red.json`,
2026-10-01 06:59:40.1183981--06:59:49.5575550 UTC, is excluded:1 PASS/1 setup FAIL.
The adapter incorrectly assumed the referenced Core primitive bridge module was
present in the Operations VBProject. Subscript-out-of-range is neither product
RED nor desktop error5. There is no compile evidence for that attempt. Settings,
canonical package pins, unassisted closure and delayed zero Excel audit pass.

Corrected probes run at the existing Operations owner call sites immediately
after real reads return. They preserve the payload, capture the local state at
that boundary in memory, then sign out. Observed subsequent reads cover the
reusable owner's eight Inventory entity-read sites, released Recipe validation,
Recipe graph/Process payload reads and the form's Process/Recipe list reads.
No reverse dependency or new runtime bridge is introduced.

Controller `reports/runtime/production-run-local-controller/1c67e19b1b1049d7b1424dc85eb5c085`,

unique checks**. All11 cases prove an available owning read returned before
sign-out: four Load boundaries, Scale's Inventory read, three Loader Refresh
boundaries, Manager Refresh and both allocation actions. All11 currently continue
observed reads/change the captured local projection, lack the required refusal
and lack an original-context attempt without a misattributed outcome (44 FAIL).
Five cases also mutate owner state beyond its captured boundary (49 FAIL total).
Earlier local clearing/scaling/loading effects are retained rather than rolled
back. All guard checks occur before fixture reset. No unhandled errors occur.

All42 shared checks retain exact GREEN order; the common fixture's five final
preservation checks pass. Five compiles, canonical pins, settings/package
preservation, unassisted closure and delayed zero Excel Application failures pass.
Runtime/static metrics remain unchanged;363 scripts parse. This covers the
specified read-return boundaries, not every possible source failure or yield.

## Multi-key stock allocation RED

`Test-Slice4beProductionRunLocal.ps1 -StockOnly` extends the common fault fixture
with `Slice4beProductionRunStock.ps1`. It preserves the original List/Tree Apply
handlers. Admin Seed supplies the first entity; the owning receiving writer and
processor create a distinct second `System_Key` at the same location before
measured local planning. Identities and quantities remain in memory.

Two initial attempts are excluded before any stock action. Both have39 PASS/one
harness FAIL, five compiles, canonical package/settings preservation, unassisted
closure and delayed zero Excel Application1000/1001/1002 events:

- Controller `production-run-local-controller/da6671d81b6f4d2eaa63e65d48c2bc48`,
  result `slice4be-production-run-stock/8071bcc215d043a6a11dd4a059060c05/red.json`,
  2026-10-01 07:12:09.5355313--07:13:28.7362455 UTC: SeedShape setup failure.
- Controller `production-run-local-controller/59621de216a34cf992c567db5f383b47`,
  result `slice4be-production-run-stock/429f40a2cf744ef1969eedebceac284e/red.json`,
  2026-10-01 07:17:31.2161879--07:18:53.9716061 UTC: narrower diagnostics identify
  the fixed seed-quantity assumption. These paths are beneath `reports/runtime/`.

The corrected fixture derives its sizes from the available quantity returned by
the owning Inventory read. With each entity quantity q, requirement2q+2, inputs
q+1 and75% each force two-key expansion;2q+1 exceeds stock while remaining below
the requirement. Zero must clear both allocations. This changes test setup only;
it neither changes Seed behavior nor establishes a Seed quantity defect.

Corrected controller `production-run-local-controller/f3d5506fd2f9440980992912bd18333a`,

2026-10-01 07:19:56.5153890--07:21:43.9162408 UTC: **82 PASS/56 expected FAIL/138
unique checks**. All eight actual-handler allocation cases pass: quantity takes
precedence over percentage, percentage-only input expands across both original
keys, zero clears both, and over-stock refusal preserves the earlier plan/inputs.
Exact identities and on-hand quantities remain unchanged; no submission occurs.
All failures are missing observation-pair, context, redaction and terminal facts,
including explicit exclusion of both exact keys from the observation payload.

All42 prior shared GREEN identities retain exact order. Five compiles, canonical
package pins, saved authority/operator bytes, unknown values/formula, older
records and other-warehouse activity preservation pass. Closure is unassisted;
delayed Excel Application1000/1001/1002 failures are zero. Runtime source and the
validated static baseline remain unchanged; all365 repository PowerShell scripts
returned by `rg --files -g '*.ps1'` parse. This is packaged handler evidence,
not visible operator or human acceptance. Preserve all138 checks through GREEN.

## Worksheet allocation RED

`Test-Slice4beProductionRunLocal.ps1 -WorksheetOnly` installs
`Slice4beProductionRunWorksheet.ps1` into the unsaved packaged form. Admin Seed
provides the exact inventory identity; a disposable operator Production table
stages that identity with reordered managed headers, custom data and a formula.
The real List/Tree Apply handlers run on their respective pages while a decoy
workbook is active. Inactive-page inputs deliberately differ. No legacy recipe
fallback or canonical inventory write is introduced.

Controller `reports/runtime/production-run-local-controller/96682e2fc5d0454e8f6dc760d6cbfbc6`,
result `reports/runtime/slice4be-production-run-worksheet/62829354876041d491e2146f799dc441/red.json`,
2026-10-01 07:27:40.5323304--07:29:19.7323917 UTC: **156 PASS/116 expected FAIL/272
unique checks**. Six ordinary cases per handler pass: quantity-source priority,
percentage-source priority, quantity-only inference, zero, over100% refusal after
input mirroring, and wrong-location refusal that clears an earlier allocation.
Checks retain normalized-header writes, List/Tree synchronization and overrides.
All16 cases preserve custom columns/formula, exact identity and canonical source.

Two unavailable-surface cases per handler expose a presentation contradiction: a missing
palette table or QUANTITY column still produces an allocation-updated success
message. FAILED owner facts are already required, but changing that message needs
Architecture D18 decision RUN-UI-01 because the contract also preserves existing
operator messages. These four assertions are a pending proposal, not approved RED;
they do not authorize rollback or repair of missing surfaces. The other112 failures
are missing observation/context/redaction/terminal facts. Tests do not pin the
accidental local UI changes in unavailable-surface cases as required behavior.

Forty-two prior shared GREEN checks retain exact order. Five compiles, canonical
package pins, saved authority/operator bytes, unknown values/formula, older
records and other-warehouse preservation pass. Unassisted closure and delayed zero
Excel Application failures are verified. Runtime/static metrics remain unchanged;
366 repository PowerShell scripts parse. Preserve the268 approved checks through
GREEN; the remaining four presentation assertions depend on RUN-UI-01 approval.
Worksheet load/clear/refresh branches, remaining read failures and independent
paired paths still require evidence. This gate is not visible or human acceptance.

## Headless Core catalog24 GREEN

Unpromoted `deploy/validation-production-run-catalog-01` implements only the Core
part of the approved Run contract. `modProductionRunCodes` supplies the nine
definitions and fixed outcomes. `modActivityCatalog`, `modActivityReferences` and
`modEvaluationMatches` route those definitions, reject unsupported/nonempty source
references and require the exact declared positive outcome for CommandCompleted.
No Run form handler or workflow algorithm changed. RUN-UI-01 is not implemented.

492 PASS/272 FAIL RED's exact ordered identities. All118 catalog23 definitions are
unchanged in catalog24; defaults, outcomes, references and terminal cases pass.
Forty-two shared checks, five instrumented compiles, candidate pins, preservation,
normal closure and delayed zero Excel Application failures pass.

Build `reports/runtime/run-catalog-build-01`,2026-10-01
07:32:41.1624265--07:33:20.9863254 UTC, passes five-package generation and independent
cold-start compile. The settings snapshot precedes the build and is retained only
in memory; restoration, frozen candidate preservation, unassisted cleanup and
delayed zero Excel audit pass. Compiled comparison allows exactly three modified
Core components and the one new codes module;270 prior components are unchanged
ignoring identifier casing, with string literals compared exactly and none lost.

`reports/runtime/run-catalog-static-01` has281 components/6154 procedures/135103
lines: growth1/4/97 for the catalog feature. Calls remain9 literal/45 unresolved,
duplicates remain190, and all28 oversized caps do not grow. Three schemas and365
tooling PowerShell parses pass. Fifteen current-output assertions advance their
exact catalog expectation23->24, with policy count118->127; historical catalog
fixtures retain their original versions. Broader workflow regression is still
required. The candidate has127 definitions, but Run observation coverage does not
increase until the handlers are integrated and their actual-handler gates pass.

independent paths, plus remaining shared/full-release gates, are not rerun here;
the recorded frozen catalog23 acceptance remains separate from this candidate.

## Worksheet Clear and Refresh owner baseline

On the catalog24 candidate, `-WorksheetOwnerOnly` exercises both real Refresh
handlers and Clear with their local surfaces present or unavailable. Controller
`reports/runtime/production-run-local-controller/a6db581725d841118533048336893cc5`,
result `reports/runtime/slice4be-production-run-worksheet-owner/555fc5547190439ebd46d7bb0f62e5da/red.json`,
2026-10-01 08:07:08.5045527--08:08:50.3581007 UTC: **84 PASS/38 FAIL/122 checks**.
Thirty-six failures are missing observations; two expose Clear's existing owner
binding defect. All42 prior shared GREEN checks retain exact order; five compiles,
canonical candidate pins, saved authority/operator bytes, unknown values/formulas,
older records, settings restoration, normal cleanup and delayed zero Excel
Application failures pass. Runtime source and static metrics are unchanged;
367 repository PowerShell scripts parse.

The fixture uses the supported Core Production surface and an Admin-seeded exact
System_Key. It stages only the owned unsaved operator workbook, activates a decoy,
and temporarily renames local surfaces. Both Refresh buttons preserve the real
LOCAL owner's Boolean result: a missing invSys table returns False; ordinary
success does not prove freshness and can retain cached data. Custom columns,
formula and exact key survive all six cases; canonical entity values and saved
authority remain unchanged. Ordinary Clear deletes generated chooser/palette
tables and clears chooser/output/check contents as before.

**Captured-owner defect:** with the operator's Production sheet unavailable,
`BtnClearRecipeChooser` resolves an `OtherAddin` worksheet; ordinary Clear resolves
`Captured`. The read-only probe observes the actual resolved Worksheet before
cleanup. `ResolveBoundProductionWorkbook(requiredSheet)` rejects a bound workbook
missing that sheet; `ResolveProductionWorkbook` searches elsewhere, then
`SheetExists` can fall back to `ThisWorkbook`. This violates the existing captured
workbook invariant and D18's missing-owner-surface rule. The two failing checks
are `CLEAR.Missing.RealOwnerResultAndNotificationCount` and
`CLEAR.Missing.OwnerUsesCapturedWorkbook` under `RunWorksheetOwner`. The eventual
guard must prevent entering another workbook/add-in owner; a quiet Sub return is
not successful completion. No broad resolver rewrite or message exception is
approved by this diagnosis. RUN-UI-01 remains pending and separate.

Only three notification calls are captured in memory by unsaved adapters; their
owning work and handlers run normally. Notification counts are automated evidence,
not native modal or visible operator acceptance. Raw reports and workbook names
stay in memory; the diagnostic outputs only fixed target categories.

Three incomplete fixture attempts are excluded: controller `18ffd54c0ce74cf2ad4590f9e314cf17`
failed an exact notification seam before handler execution; `9e26b032a3c747509d838844ba125c21`
and `3d761ac58b904d878e30c6a070df3b64` stopped during Clear staging because default
row insertion would shift neighboring tables. Using the surface's reserved blank
row with `AlwaysInsert:=False` corrected setup. All had normal preservation/cleanup
and delayed zero Excel audits; the latter two compiled all five packages.
The completed120-check diagnostic, controller `4bd5235e4ea14784a94f7361dc7c6d0f`,
result `slice4be-production-run-worksheet-owner/94e693a7ddca45f5a96acd62caff272a/red.json`,
was83 PASS/37 FAIL; the final122 retains those identities and adds the two explicit
Clear owner-target checks. Its five compiles, preservation, normal cleanup and
delayed audit also pass.

## Clear captured-owner guard

The populated-decoy extension retains the122 checks and adds14. Controller

Clear resolves `OtherWorkbook` when a populated Production sheet exists on the
active decoy, then clears its chooser contents, including its custom value and
formula. This proves an actual cross-workbook mutation, not just a misleading
status. With no decoy surface it resolves `OtherAddin`. Five binding/preservation
failures and42 missing-observation failures supply RED. All earlier PASS results,
five compiles, package/settings/saved authority preservation, unassisted closure
and delayed zero Excel audit pass.

Unpromoted `deploy/validation-production-run-binding-01` adds
`modProductionRunBinding.BindWorksheetOwner`: require the original workbook object
to be in Application.Workbooks, not an add-in, and contain the Production sheet;
only then bind it to the existing owner. Worksheet Clear calls this guard before
entering `BtnClearRecipeChooser`. Reusable Clear, ordinary cleanup, current
messages, other handlers and the general fallback resolver are unchanged. This
implements the existing captured-workbook and missing-owner requirements; no new
architectural exception or RUN-UI-01 approval is inferred. Missing-sheet Clear
returns before the owner and its success notification/status. FAILED tracking
still needs the separate Run observation integration.

All five binding checks change RED->GREEN, all89 earlier PASS checks remain GREEN,
and all136 identities/order are retained. Both unavailable-sheet cases report
`NotEntered`; ordinary Clear remains `Captured`. Decoy contents/custom formula
are preserved. Five compiles, package pins, saved/local/settings/older-record
preservation, normal cleanup and delayed zero Excel audit pass. Despite the
driver's `green.json` filename, **the overall suite remains RED** for42 missing
observations. No Run observation coverage or human acceptance is gained here.

Build `reports/runtime/run-binding-build-01`,2026-10-01
08:14:45.3863653--08:15:23.7254859 UTC, passes five-package generation and independent
cold-start compile. Prebuild settings capture/restoration and the prior catalog24
candidate's package preservation pass. Compiled comparison identifies one changed
form and one new Production module;273 other components are preserved, comparing
string literals exactly and ignoring identifier case, with none removed. The
delayed build Excel audit is zero; it was performed after the subsequent owner
gate had already started, rather than before starting that gate.

All503 identities/order and all171 prior PASS checks are preserved. The only seven
changed results are FixedMetadata checks, now GREEN because catalog24 is present;
the binding guard does not claim those catalog changes. All33 existing owner
cases pass. Seven native-close receipts retain four surviving/invoked handlers
and three dismissed surfaces. Five compiles, canonical candidate pins, settings/
saved authority/operator bytes/older records, unassisted cleanup and delayed zero
Excel audit pass. This remains a RED observation/guard suite; it does not replace
the separate unresolved full reusable171/two-aggregate/replay37 acceptance gates.

## Worksheet Apply Scale baseline and binding guard

`-WorksheetScaleOnly` invokes the actual Apply Scale handler in its non-reusable
branch, with Admin-seeded identity, supported Core staging surfaces and the real
released reusable Recipe selector entry. After Seed, the actual Admin Settings
save handler explicitly enables `DesignsEnabled`; the fixture verifies it before
the action gate. No Domain return is replaced and no legacy recipe is imported.

2026-10-01 08:36:15.1025891--08:37:56.6499880 UTC: **120 PASS/65 FAIL/185 checks**.
Nine cases cover no selection, nonnumeric scale, below/above bounds, unavailable
Design/BOM at ordinary/minimum/maximum scale, missing captured Production sheet,
and that missing sheet with an active decoy Production sheet. Sixty-three failures
are missing observations; two prove owner retargeting to `OtherAddin` and
`OtherWorkbook`. The decoy's custom value/formula remains unchanged in this failure
fixture; unlike Clear's earlier defect, this run does not prove cross-workbook
mutation. All42 shared GREEN checks, five compiles, canonical candidate pins,
saved authority/operator bytes/unknown values/formulas/older records/settings,
normal unassisted cleanup and delayed zero Excel audit pass.

The owner queries `tblDesigns` through the released Design/BOM bridge, while the
selected reusable Recipe is stored separately. Its real read returns no staging
workbook. The existing Sub then returns to the caller, which still scales the
existing named worksheet quantity columns at valid percentages. The probe retains
those partial effects and unknown columns/exact identity. Validation refusals
occur before owner entry, and all nine cases preserve canonical source values.
There is no legacy fallback with the feature enabled. These facts require FAILED
observations for owner-read failures; they neither prove a successful worksheet
load nor authorize changing its algorithm or routing Apply Scale to a different
owner. Positive Design/BOM rebuild and Designs-disabled branch coverage remain
open, including D14 preservation through rebuild.

Unpromoted `deploy/validation-production-run-binding-02` changes only the worksheet
scale helper's binding line to use `modProductionRunBinding.BindWorksheetOwner`
before `LoadRecipeChooser`. This enforces the existing captured-workbook/D18 rule.
Selection/scale validation and prior tree-state clearing keep their original
order; no rollback is claimed. Reusable Scale and existing owner-read/partial
scaling algorithms are unchanged. No new operator wording is introduced.

## Tree presentation observation implementation

Unpromoted `deploy/validation-production-run-presentation-01` integrates the two
approved Expand/Collapse observations using `modProductionRunPresentation` and
the existing `cProductionWorksheetAction`. The two actual Click handlers call the
coordinator; the existing tree dictionary/rebuild routine remains the owner.
Its existing messages and presentation behavior are retained. Loading/busy and
captured workbook/warehouse/session/capability checks precede owner entry. Errors
retain their original propagation after recording FAILED and restoring guards.
Optional tracking has no authority to prevent the local action. No source-event
reference, inventory application or release workflow conclusion is introduced.
The seven other Run controls remain unintegrated; RUN-SCALE-01 and RUN-UI-01 remain
pending separate approvals.

## Tree presentation Action Paths

`Test-Slice4beProductionRunPresentation.ps1 -PathsOnly` extends the shared path
harness through `Test-ProductionInstructionPaths -RunPresentation`. This adds
verification of the approved D18 contract without changing runtime source or
packages. The existing232-check RED/GREEN protects observation implementation;
this separate gate tests downstream use of those observations.

All42 prior shared GREEN identities/order remain intact. Two independent runs
invoke the actual Collapse then Expand handlers against synthetic local tree
rows, retaining palette state and exact original recording order. This is not
inventory allocation or a seeded production-chain fixture. Actual Admin
publication retains all eight original observation records. Event Detail selects
REQUESTED and exact PRESENTED terminal fields; authored guide intent and a reader
without author capability bind the guide to the separate observed run. Both
actions match, zero extra actions occur, CommandCompleted concludes and
SourceEventsApplied remains Incomplete/SOURCE_UNAVAILABLE. How-To, Diagnostic
and Compare both preserve the same guide/run evidence. Saved authority, operator
bytes, unknown local values and original journals/activity remain unchanged.
Five package compiles, canonical presentation01 pins, settings preservation,
unassisted closure and delayed zero Excel Application audit pass.

Six principal captures in that result directory were inspected: `run-presentation-`
`editor.png`, `event-detail.png`, `how-to.png`, `diagnostic.png`, `compare-both.png`
and `conclusion.png`. The two authored steps and local-only conclusion are
readable. Diagnostic shows both matches and zero extra actions; scrolling Compare
both reveals the complete identity pairs. Long Event Detail coverage text exceeds
its initial viewport. The experimental Run Tree has visibly overlapping
System_Key/Inventory Item headings and truncated long synthetic row text. Record
this as **RUN-TREE-LAYOUT-01**, pending an actual-form geometry test and diagnosis;
do not count the populated Tree layout or human acceptance as passed. No layout
repair or new architectural exception is implemented here.

Static `reports/runtime/run-presentation-paths-static-01` remains283 components/

Runtime source, package identity and constructed-button coverage57/68 are unchanged.

independent recordings, publication, selected Event Detail, explicit expectation
and separate reader views retain their previous semantics. Two matched CLOSED
actions do not distinguish the gestures or prove saved work/Domain application.
Five compiles, canonical candidate pins, settings/authority/recording preservation,
normal unassisted closure and delayed zero Excel Application audit pass. Reviewed
`close-how-to.png` and `close-conclusion.png` show both instructions, two matches,
zero extras and the local-only conclusion; the last long identity line has a
viewport limit. This is regression evidence, not new human/full-layout acceptance.

## Clear worksheet owner and continuation checkpoint

The expanded actual-handler gate adds33 checks at three real boundaries: the
worksheet Clear notification, Inventory picker return and default-location
return. It signs out after each owning boundary, then requires no further work,
preserved boundary state, fixed refusal, restored guards and only the original
REQUESTED record. Existing explicit cleanup effects are retained, not rolled
back; inventory custom values/formulas, exact System_Key and canonical source
remain preserved. Diagnostic state stays in memory in unsaved probes.

All136 prior identities/order/results remain exact. Twelve new failures expose
continued work after sign-out, absent refusal and absent original observations.
Two preceding fixture runs are excluded: an object-array coercion caused VBA424
and assisted cleanup reset fixture memory (then VBA13); the following run failed
to restore seed-reference fields after constructing a new form. The final fixture
uses an object collection, restores its reference fields and reauthenticates only
after interruption checks for the final authoritative preservation read.

Implementation: `modProductionRunClearActions` observes the unchanged reset and
five list clears, or captured worksheet cleanup/refresh. Scoped typed continuation
checks stop after yielding boundaries before further reads or local assignment.
Optional tracking, permission checks and exceptions use the established action
observer; original error propagation and local-only outcomes remain governed by
D18. No pending Scale/UI proposal is implemented.

## Clear independent Action Path checkpoint

This test/evidence-only extension exercises approved D18 through the actual Clear
handler. Before each recording, prepare both a released reusable Run and separate
worksheet staging. The first Clear resets the reusable Run and its five lists;
the second clears the remaining worksheet staging and completes its notification

captured binding, custom columns/formulas, exact System_Key and canonical authority
are asserted. The adapter does not reset guards after the action.

Only `RunClearPaths.GuideSource.Reusable.OriginalHandlerPair` fails; the existing

identities remain in order and all47 prior PASS checks survive;42 shared GREEN
checks retain their exact order. Independent source-guide and observed runs each
produce two original REQUESTED/STAGED pairs. All eight records publish unchanged;
selected Event Detail distinguishes REQUESTED from the exact STAGED line. Explicit
ordered expectations and an independent reader match two actions with zero extras.
CommandCompleted concludes; SourceEventsApplied remains incomplete/SOURCE_UNAVAILABLE.
Both observations share one control identity and do not distinguish owner branches.

Six captures under the GREEN result directory were reviewed: `run-clear-editor.png`,
`run-clear-event-detail.png`, `run-clear-how-to.png`, `run-clear-diagnostic.png`,
`run-clear-compare-both.png`, and `run-clear-conclusion.png`. The guide visibly
states the initial setup and diagnostic limits. All three views retain independent
source/observed provenance and local-only completion. The editor shows cleared
lists while preserving existing selector/input values; this is not a full-form
reset. Long Event Detail coverage exceeds the initial viewport. Agent review does
not establish human or full-layout acceptance.

does not establish new populated-layout or human acceptance.

## Load read-return continuation checkpoint

Under the unchanged D18 Load contract, the actual handler now uses a typed action
coordinator and passes its captured action through released validation, graph and
Process reads and inventory-backed refresh rows. The existing Process-definition
loader is extracted into `modProductionRunDefinitionLoad`, retaining the same
collections, iteration, record helpers, messages and partial-state behavior.
`modProductionRunLoadActions` observes the owning result and restores guards.
Direct preparation callers retain the original behavior through an omitted action;
both the operator and existing fixture preparation reach the same Stage routine.
No new global continuation, Domain submission or Application.Run call is added.

identical to the prior read-return baseline. All four Load reads return real data
before the fixture signs out. Load then continues reads or form updates and lacks
the required refusal/original observation. These are behavioral failures, with
five compiles, preserved packages/settings/authority/operator bytes, normal cleanup
and a delayed zero Excel Application audit.

read interruption, no later observed read or form update occurs, existing owner

REQUESTED record remains. The30 failures concern other unintegrated controls.
Five compiles, package/settings/authority/operator preservation, unassisted cleanup

## Run entry binding gap discovered during Load regression

The first Load candidate's reusable503 run is **236 PASS/267 FAIL**, controller
`reports/runtime/production-run-local-controller/e12807d50bb442008094896c8aa23a74`,
result `reports/runtime/slice4be-production-run-local/f1949dad477e4219b6d29b23ec5268a3/green.json`,
10:42:40.8968930--10:48:40.0655797 UTC. All58 Load checks pass, but two previous
Scale GREEN checks fail: `RunLocal.ClosedBoundary.SCALE.UserActionProtected` and
`RunLocal.ClosedBoundary.SCALE.OwnerStatePreserved`. This run is not accepted.

Native receipts establish the cause: the Scale form survived workbook closure
and its actual handler ran; the preceding clear01 run dismissed that surface.
The unchanged Scale handler lacked an entry context guard. Both runs have four
invoked and three dismissed surfaces, but different controls survived; those
counts are observations, not an architectural lifetime guarantee. Every receipt
must establish the real lifetime and, when visible, actual handler entry/refusal.
Do not waive a previously GREEN check or manufacture a replacement form.

The same missing entry guard exists in both Refresh and both Apply handlers.
Their Target/Session/SignedOut actual-handler tests already supply RED. A shared
`modProductionRunBinding.RequireCurrentContext` check now protects all five entry
points before owner work. This implements existing captured-binding requirements;
it neither integrates their observations nor changes their algorithms, the pending
Designs-enabled worksheet Scale decision, or allocation-message proposals.

Operations startup/five compiles, restored settings, preserved previous candidate,
normal closure and delayed zero Excel audit. Compared with clear01,274 existing
compiled components remain unchanged; the form, reusable owner and binding helper
change and two helpers are added (277 to279 components). Intermediate load02 had
only the Scale guard; its build/cleanup/delayed audit passed without an acceptance
claim. No operational deployment or workbook replacement occurs.

Static `reports/runtime/run-load-static-03` is286/6165/135319, feature growth2/6/91.

acceptance of this candidate.

## Independent Load Action Paths

The unchanged D18 Load contract is now exercised through separate guide-source
and observed recordings on unpromoted load03. Each recording begins with a real
released selection, valid scale and prior allocated local run already prepared.
The actual `mBtnLoaderLoad_Click` replaces that preparation and refreshes the
local rows. Setup is outside the recording. No runtime code or contract changes.

The initial negative-control attempt, controller
`reports/runtime/production-run-local-controller/cff51cf529c1457297d51e8019858f6d`,
result `reports/runtime/slice4be-production-run-load-paths/b7a765c000ad49e688324d9d57c7971d/red.json`,
has45 PASS/two FAIL and is superseded: a combined owner/message assertion assumed
`100%`, while the existing formatter displays `100.%`. The corrected test separates
owner state from message format and accepts the existing equivalent numeric text.
It does not change the product or weaken the exact owner-state assertions.

retain their relative order and all47 prior PASS checks survive; shared42 remain
exact. Each independent recording contains one original REQUESTED/STAGED pair.
Actual Admin publication preserves all four records. Selected Event Detail follows
the requested and terminal lines. The saved guide preserves exact source provenance
and explicit expectation; a separate non-author reader pairs it with the observed
run in How-To, Diagnostic and Compare both. One matched STAGED action and zero
extras conclude CommandCompleted; SourceEventsApplied remains Incomplete with
SOURCE_UNAVAILABLE. Viewing preserves recordings, publications and authority.

Both decisive runs pass five instrumented package compiles, canonical package pins,
settings/preservation, normal unassisted closure and delayed zero Excel Application
audits. The earlier superseded attempt also preserves settings/packages and closes
normally, with a clear delayed audit. No production deployment occurs.

Six captures reviewed under the GREEN result directory: `run-load-editor.png`,
`run-load-event-detail.png`, `run-load-how-to.png`, `run-load-diagnostic.png`,
`run-load-compare-both.png` and `run-load-conclusion.png`. The populated editor shows
loaded inputs/output, no allocated inventory check rows, and reset actual output/
batch note; existing palette input values remain. The guide makes the preselected
Recipe/scale prerequisite and local replacement explicit. Control observations
do not identify the selected Recipe. The diagnostic displays the independent run
and local-only conclusion. Long synthetic names in lists and Event Detail Coverage
still have viewport limits; these captures do not close populated-layout or human
acceptance requirements.

preservation, normal unassisted closure and delayed zero Excel audit pass. This
protects the established two-branch Clear guide and observed-run comparison through
the extended shared harness. Remaining Run/release and human acceptance stay open.

## Loader and Manager Refresh continuation

Existing D18 requires distinct Loader/Manager sequences, unchanged messages and
local-only REFRESHED. The actual local read-model owner must succeed; false is
FAILED even though subsequent local refresh remains. No source freshness or
availability is inferred from fail-soft reads. Both existing handlers now delegate
to `modProductionRunRefreshActions`, which scopes the captured action and restores
loading/busy guards. Existing reusable row reads receive the action; recipe-list
reads now check both the existing Assignment and scoped Run continuation. Original
exceptions are re-raised. No additional Domain work, fallback or dynamic call.

Every prior ordered identity/PASS remains;26 Refresh failures become GREEN.
Original errors and partial local behavior remain, nested clicks enter the owner
once and produce one original pair, and guards restore before adapter reset.
Both companions pass five compiles, canonical pins, settings/authority/operator/
older-record preservation, normal unassisted cleanup and delayed zero Excel audits.
Remaining failures belong to unintegrated controls; neither gate proves full release
or resolves prior excluded native failures.

All prior ordered identities/PASS survive; exactly20 Refresh checks improve.
All33 existing-owner cases and42 shared checks pass. Each of seven forms remains
visible after its captured workbook closes; the actual handler executes, refuses
the stale binding and preserves owner state, saved bytes and activity attribution.
The decoy remains open and native receipts establish the correct List/Tree page.
Five compiles, canonical package pins, settings/authority/operator/older-record
preservation, normal unassisted cleanup and delayed zero Excel audit pass. The
214 failures remain in unintegrated controls. Independent Refresh Action Paths,
populated layout, broad release gates and full reusable acceptance remain open.

## Independent Refresh Action Paths

The test-only `-RefreshPathsOnly` gate uses the two actual Refresh handlers and
Clear Run under unchanged D18. Both reusable and separate worksheet staging exist
before each recording starts. The sequence is Loader Refresh, Manager Refresh,
Clear Run, worksheet Loader Refresh and worksheet Manager Refresh. No owner reset
or hidden staging occurs between clicks. A read-only cumulative receipt proves
zero LOCAL worksheet reads in the reusable branch, then one and two successful
reads against the captured workbook. Owner state, original messages, guards,
staging, exact keys, custom columns/formulas and canonical source remain protected.

Frozen load03 RED: controller

result `reports/runtime/slice4be-production-run-refresh-paths/f4d50e14e2c74cdcbeb783712a2f9ef3/red.json`,
2026-10-01 12:27:14.3137541--12:29:26.0025739 UTC: **49 PASS / 1 FAIL / 50 unique**.
Only the first Refresh's missing original observation pair fails. Its actual
owner/message, read receipt, staging, guards and preservation checks pass. Five
compiles, canonical pins, settings restoration, normal closure and delayed zero
Excel Application1000/1001/1002 audit pass; this is behavioral RED.

Unchanged refresh01 GREEN: controller
`reports/runtime/production-run-local-controller/8bdf6c8a91894f0587ca7983e40daf5b`,
result `reports/runtime/slice4be-production-run-refresh-paths/3881639181784fcebeaf5ce9f04f710a/green.json`,
12:29:45.5668394--12:39:08.1445870 UTC: **167/167 unique GREEN**. All 50 RED check
identities retain their relative order and all 49 previous passes survive; the
42 shared checks remain GREEN. Independent source/observed recordings each retain
five actions in exact order. Publication preserves all 20 original records. Event
Detail selects the actual REQUESTED/REFRESHED line. The authored guide preserves
exact source provenance and explicit ordered intent; a reader without author
capability applies it to the other recording. Five matches and zero extras
conclude CommandCompleted only; SourceEventsApplied remains Incomplete with
SOURCE_UNAVAILABLE. How-To, Diagnostic and Compare both retain the same evidence.

Five instrumented compiles, canonical package pins, settings/authority/operator/
activity/journal preservation, unassisted cleanup and delayed zero audit pass.
Six `run-refresh-*.png` captures were reviewed: operator, Event Detail, How-To,
Diagnostic, Compare both and scrolled conclusion. Authored instructions fit and
the conclusion explicitly declines Domain application. Synthetic worksheet rows
prove retained local staging, not production validity; long synthetic values and
Event Detail Coverage retain viewport limits. These are agent-reviewed captures,
not human acceptance or full populated-layout acceptance.

Static `reports/runtime/run-refresh-paths-static-01` retains 287 components,
6166 procedures and 135351 lines, with zero runtime growth; calls remain 9/45,
duplicate candidates 190 and all 28 oversized caps non-growing. Three schemas
and 368 PowerShell parses pass. Runtime and architecture are unchanged by this
test-only checkpoint; broader release acceptance remains open.

Shared-harness regressions on the same refresh01 candidate:

- Load paths retain **87/87** in exact prior order: controller
  `reports/runtime/production-run-local-controller/3d32017e86e94d72a6d698ed2e96f1f8`,
  result `reports/runtime/slice4be-production-run-load-paths/19236b145dbe46ecbcd1bf2eafe04e2d/green.json`,
  12:39:30.1147547--12:45:22.0419262 UTC.
- Clear paths retain **102/102** in exact prior order: controller
  `reports/runtime/production-run-local-controller/66c441dc33474bce9a188736f29138cc`,
  result `reports/runtime/slice4be-production-run-clear-paths/454c99dc99fb4621913723b2508a84f1/green.json`,
  12:45:40.9353944--12:52:01.7199143 UTC.

Both preserve all 42 shared checks, pass five compiles and canonical package pins,
retain settings/authority/operator/activity/journal evidence, close normally and
pass delayed zero Excel audits. No unrelated changes or generated runtime reports
are included in the checkpoint.

The shared Ingredients Assignment safety regression on refresh01 retains 789/789
after correcting its malformed older-policy fixture, with all prior identities
and order unchanged. No runtime correction was needed; the strict reader correctly
rejected catalog24 Run rows mislabeled as catalog22. See the owning record,
`plan022_slice4be_production_assignment_results.md`, for the failed fixture run,
corrected receipt, exact results, native lifetime qualification and static evidence.
The focused companion retains 349/349 in exact prior order, with five compiles,
preservation, normal unassisted closure and delayed zero Excel audit.

## Remaining gates

Before List/Tree Apply integration, the unchanged refresh01 candidate reproduces
the original worksheet baseline: controller
`reports/runtime/production-run-local-controller/e447938ef7a7492295dfb6c757cfc228`,
result `reports/runtime/slice4be-production-run-worksheet/736e90b9aa0e4fdda37fe53fb0037d48/red.json`,
2026-10-01 13:14:25.2353045--13:16:09.3919636 UTC, **156 PASS / 116 FAIL / 272
unique**. All previous identities, order and results are retained. The approved
268-check contract has 156 passes and 112 missing-observation failures; four
`UnavailableSurfaceNotReportedComplete` assertions remain proposed RUN-UI-01
wording checks, not approved implementation requirements. Five compiles,
canonical refresh01 pins, settings/operator/authority/older-record preservation,
normal unassisted closure and delayed zero Excel Application1000/1001/1002 audit
pass. No runtime, algorithm, message or approval change is made in this baseline.

Preserve the seven worksheet-owner cases and the five binding GREEN checks through
Run handler integration, together with the185 Scale checks and two binding GREEN
checks. Positive worksheet Scale tests must distinguish quiet helper return
from successful owner completion: `mProduction.LoadRecipeChooser` is a Sub,
and the scale branch subsequently scales/prepares local tables. Actual-handler
evidence confirms that helper queries the Design/BOM bridge (`tblDesigns`) for a
selection supplied by the released reusable Recipe selector. D15 requires only
released Process/Recipe projections with Designs enabled; D18's instruction to
preserve the non-reusable branch must not be interpreted as waiving that rule.
This authority mismatch needs explicit reconciliation before owner-routing work.
Do not create a matching legacy Design merely to make the modern Recipe fixture
pass. Record a normative clarification/decision and synchronize Plan022/Controls
before any changed contract; until then preserve the guarded branch and report
its observed failure honestly. D14 preservation through a successful rebuild is
still unproven. Missing fixtures and modal setup failures are not behavioral RED.

Load Recipe itself always calls the released reusable loader; the worksheet
reload helper is reached by non-reusable Apply Scale. Do not invent a separate
worksheet Load-button branch from the helper's name.

Preserve every established presentation baseline identity through GREEN. Add the
other seven owner behaviors and complete
context/policy/failure coverage; then require packaged XLAM, compile, layout,
static maintenance, live roles, full Release1 chain, reusable and independent
Action Path evidence. Agent inspection is not human acceptance.
